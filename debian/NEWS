wordpress (3.4+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  1/ The default configuration now sets WP_CONTENT_DIR to
  /var/lib/wordpress/wp-content to respect the FHS and to cleanly allow the
  installation of local plugins and themes. You might have to adjust your
  Apache configuration with a directive to override the default wp-content
  directory with this one. For a dedicated virtual host, it could be the this:

    Alias /wp-content /var/lib/wordpress/wp-content

  If you want to disable this default setting and come back to the former
  situation, you can add this in your /etc/wordpress/config-*.php
  configuration file:

    define( 'DONT_SET_WP_CONTENT_DIR', true);

  2/ The "default" and "default-fr" theme are gone. If you're using one of
  them, make sure to install them manually in
  /var/lib/wordpress/wp-content/themes.
