wordpress (3.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The Flash-based SWFUpload tool is no longer distributed in the Debian
  package, as it cannot be built from source and violates the Debian Policy
  (cf. bug #591195).

  This tool can be enabled by manually installing it, as documented in
  /usr/share/doc/wordpress/README.Debian.
