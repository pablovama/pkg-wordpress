Missing source files
--------------------

WordPress ships a tar.gz ready to use that embeds many minified javascript
libraries as well as several compiled Flash files. The GPL requires you
to provide the corresponding source code. WordPress complies to this
through the page at http://wordpress.org/download/source/.

For Debian this is not really acceptable so instead we bundle all the
missing source files in this directory. They have been grabbed from the
above page (when it was up-to-date) or directly from the various upstream
projects.

Files: wp-includes/js/crop/cropper.js
Project: Cropper-UI 1.2.0
Comment: The minified file has been patched in changeset 4768 so it's
 really its own source in truth.
