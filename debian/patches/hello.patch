-Well, hello, Dolly
-It's so nice to have you back where you belong
-You're lookin' swell, Dolly
-I can tell, Dolly
-You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
-You're still goin' strong
-We feel the room swayin'
-While the band's playin'
-One of your old favourite songs from way back when
-So, take her wrap, fellas
-Find her an empty lap, fellas
-Dolly'll never go away again
